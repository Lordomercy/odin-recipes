    <h4>It was about having to lift up quite a lot of crispy bacon before you found the miserable skulking vegetables. You might never notice them at all.</h4>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices wholewheat bread</li>
        <li>Â½ pound of bacon</li>
        <li>4 green lettuce leaves, white parts removed</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Fry up the bacon over medium heat, making sure not to crowd the pan. Remove at desired crunchiness level and set aside on a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the tomato slices in the bacon fat, around 30 seconds per side. Remove from the pan and add generous sprinkle of pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Slice bacon strips in half for easier assembly. If you like, add Worcestershire sauce (1-3 drops) to the bacon and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the sandwich, starting with bread, lettuce, tomato, bacon, then bread again.
        </li>
        <li>Methodically remove the tomato and lettuce.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy the BLT as nature intended.
        </li>

    </ol>
